## branch ruby-dsl
Email crash course on Building Ruby DSLs written by Jim Gay.

Before you start, gather your team and information and discuss the goals of your
code. Write down your answers and come back to them later as you develop your
DSL.

* What concepts do you need to capture? In addition, what barriers does plain Ruby
code create for easily understanding the concepts in your code? Can you avoid
writing a DSL?
* How are each of the concepts related? For the concepts in your system, how do
they interact with each other? You should consider how one line of code affects
the next.
* How does you system deviate from a standard approach? In other words, if you
create a standard way of doing things, now is the time to imagine how your
solution should be able to grow to support additional individual needs.
